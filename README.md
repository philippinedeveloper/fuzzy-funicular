# What is Warlock?

**Warlock** is an MIT App Inventor Extension Builder that builds extensions. It doesn't need to be installed unlike Appinventor-Sources & It does not need Apache Ant at all!, The installation of Warlock offline is Optional, but I would reccomend building extensions using Warlock online.

Supports:

Java 8 for creating extensions (dx)

Java 11 for creating extensions (d8)

Offline extension building

Online extension building

Helper blocks

DX & D8 for dexing

Progaurd for protecting from decompiling, for optimizing/shrinking, obfuscating & preverifing.

Android 34-sdk level (mainly because of updated libraries.)

DesignerComponent annotation

SimpleObject annotation

UsesLibraries annotation
